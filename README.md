# Volumio Button Page

A simple website that offers very basic volumio plaback controls.

## But why?

Why add another interface, although Volumio already offers a very convenient UI?

I installed a volumio in the kids room, used to play children music or children audio books. I already installed some GPIO Buttons for basic playback controls (play/pause, skip) which are very appreciated by the kids and are in heavy use. The only thing missing is the possibility to change the content they want to listen to. The volumio UI is far too complicated and offers way too many options, including all libraries, radio stations and settings. Therefore I needed a simple UI, running on a simple outdated phone or tablet, which is fully operable by the kids (who in my case just start basic reading).
